                <p align="left" > <strong>Dress properly for an interview </strong><br/>
A single-breasted suit is appropriate for all fields of employment. When wearing a single-breasted suit with more than two buttons, you may button all. <br/>
<br/>
<strong>Managing Your Boss</strong> <br/>
An important but most disregarded aspect of leadership is your relationship with the boss, as s/he would determine your success/ failure as a leader. <br/>
<br/>
<strong>Foolish mistakes that Job seekers make </strong><br/>
Walking in for the interview even ten minutes after the interview is scheduled for, sends a negative first impression to potential employers. <br/>
<br/>
<strong>Write an effective Resume </strong><br/>
Studies show that regardless of how long you labor over your resume, most employers will spend 10 seconds looking at it. That's it.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style27">      <strong>Have a Career Goal </strong><br/>
      A career goal helps you focus on what you want to do for a living. A career goal can be a specific job you want to do -- such as doctor or teacher. <br/>
      <br/>
      <strong>Develope a Career Plan </strong><br/>
    With all kinds of career possibilities available, how do you make a decision? Once you know what career path you want to follow.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style27"><strong>      Create a career blueprint</strong><br/>

      You excelled in the interview, you've been offered the job, and now you're down to negotiating the deal. <br/>
      <br/>
      <strong>Applying to a job through mail </strong><br/>
      Applying for a job via email is certainly more efficient but its effectiveness depends entirely on you and how seriously and professionally you approach your application.<br/>
      <br/>
      <strong>Facing Rejection </strong><br/>
      If you're applying for lots of jobs but not getting any interviews, you're probably setting yourself the wrong job targets - maybe applying for posts that are too junior in the belief that your chances of interview will increase.<br/>

      Keys to Success at Job Fairs </strong><br/>
